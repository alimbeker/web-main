    <p><img src="https://platon.asia/cache/imagine/main_page_full/uploads/news/2021/04/13/60751c8177b14676852028.jpg" width="60%" alt="60751c8177b14676852028"></p>
    <p>In Kazakhstan, it is prescribed to observe social distancing,wearing a mask and remote employment. Major events were also canceled in the country, gatherings of people were banned and travel bans were imposed.
    <br>
    <br>
    At the beginning of September 2021, some regions of the country are a "red zone", which means that all shopping and entertainment centers must comply with increased sanitary standards, rules of social distancing in the amount of 4 sq. m. per visitor, and must work on weekdays from 10:00 to 17:00. All amusement parks, playgrounds and ice rinks located on the territory of these facilities must be closed even on weekdays, with the exception of facilities participating in the Ashyq project (see details below). All shopping and entertainment centers, public transport, indoor sports facilities and shops (with the exception of pharmacies markets selling food and basic necessities) are closed on weekends.
    <br>
    <br>
    Food courts located inside entertainment centers can only offer delivery and takeaway food, with the exception of establishments participating in the Ashyq project. Free-standing restaurants, cafes and bars can work both on weekdays and weekends from 7:00 to 22:00.
    <br>
    
    <br>
    Vaccination against coronavirus became available to the public in April.
    <br>
    <br>
    Among the available vaccines is the Russian "Sputnik V" (produced at a pharmaceutical plant in Karaganda); "Hayat-Wax", which is produced in the UAE using the technology of the Chinese company Sinopharm; and the locally produced vaccine QazVac, which has passed the third phase of clinical trials. To date, almost 2 million people have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, and more than 800,000 people have been fully vaccinated.</p>

    Covid-19: Rules of entry to Kazakhstan:
</div>
  

<div style="font-size:1.5vw; text-align: center;">
<br>
    In accordance with the quarantine measures taken, the Government extended the suspension of the visa-free regime until January 2022 for citizens of the following 54 States: Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Belgium, Bulgaria, Vatican City, Great Britain, Hungary, Vietnam, Germany, Greece, Denmark, Israel, Indonesia, Ireland, Iceland, Spain, Italy, Canada, Qatar, Cyprus, Colombia, Kuwait, Latvia, Lithuania, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, Monaco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Oman, Poland, Portugal, Romania , Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, USA, Thailand, Philippines, Finland, France, Croatia, Czech Republic, Chile, Switzerland, Sweden, Estonia, Japan.
<br>
    
<br>
    The temporary cancellation of the visa-free regime does not apply to diplomatic missions, government delegations and medical workers.
<br>
    
<br>
    The cancellation of the visa-free regime also did not affect citizens of the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, South Korea , Belarus, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Egypt, Georgia and the Maldives.
<br>
    
<br>
    However, citizens of the above countries can enter the country as tourists only by air. The land borders of Kazakhstan remain closed to all except certain categories of citizens (truckers, citizens with a special government permit; having a residence permit in Kazakhstan).
<br>
    
<br>
    Kazakhstan currently operates round-trip flights to Amsterdam, Antalya, Batumi, Bishkek, Dubai, Dushanbe, Frankfurt, Istanbul, Kiev, Maldives, Montenegro, Moscow, Tashkent, Tbilisi, Seoul and the UAE. Passengers are allowed on board only in masks.
<br>
    
<br>
    Passengers are allowed to board only in a mask. In addition, a passenger arriving in Kazakhstan must be provided with a negative PCR test taken no earlier than 72 hours before departure. Citizens of Kazakhstan and holders of resident cards who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 in Kazakhstan can present a certificate of vaccination instead of a negative PCR test result. The test is not required for children under 5 years of age and passengers following transit and not leaving the transit zone.
<br>
    
<br>
    All passengers departing from Nur-Sultan and Almaty International Airports must have the Ashyq mobile application downloaded before arrival and in with an individual identification number. Without this application, they will be denied entry to the airport.
<br>
    
<br>
    The application, integrated with the data of the Ministry of Health of Kazakhstan, shows the status of a person from green (no restrictions on movement, recent negative COVID-19 test) and blue (no restrictions on movement) to yellow (contact with an infected person) and red (positive COVID-19 test). Only passengers with green or blue status will be allowed to enter the airport; those with yellow or red status will be denied entry.
<br>
    
<br>
    From July 1, vaccination data will also be integrated into the system, and citizens who have been fully vaccinated will be given a green status.
